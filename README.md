# LiviaAI

__LiviaAI__ is a proposed research project that aims to investigates the potential of 
artificial intelligence to identify patterns, connections and associations between digitized
objects in three Viennese art collections.

This page is just a placeholder while we await responses to our grant propsal.

The project discusses areas of application of artificial intelligence for museum collections online in order to make connections, clusters and similarities within individual collections and across collections more tangible. Specifically, the project builds on the excellent digitisation base of three Viennese museums (Wien Museum, Museum f√ºr angewandte Kunst, Belvedere) and will test the method of representation learning, a family of deep learning techniques, for organising and searching content in the collections of the three museums according to different similarity principles. In the process, image analysis will be linked with the analysis of keywords (semantics). So far, this procedure has been successfully applied to individual collections, but has never been used across collection boundaries. The aim of the project is on the one hand to develop the method itself, and on the other hand to develop open source software with which the digital collections of the three museums can be jointly analysed and sorted according to different similarity factors of the images (colour, form, motif, style, artist,...). This should facilitate access to the individual online collections and increase their value through broader contextualisation. To further strengthen the Vienna connection, a link to the Vienna History Wiki is also planned for the extended contextualisation of artists or other personal names.
